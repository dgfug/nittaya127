# React native template

This is just a template containing the basics of a project made with `react-native-paper`, `react-navigation` (stack), and is ready for authentication to be implemented.

It was originally made for myself (because I'm new to rn, I can't go through this everytime ðŸ™ƒ) but you can use it for yourself.

Pull requests, tips, issues, and opinions are welcomed!
